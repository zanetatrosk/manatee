# Welcome to D&D App

## About repository
This repository is a frontend part of the D&D App. It is fully developed by me, however, in some commits 
my colleague is tagged as commiter. This is due to the fact I worked for some time on his computer.

## Running the app
This app runs with Node v19.0.1. This app is fully dependent on backend from repository [Anteater](https://github.com/ph0enixCZ/anteater/tree/main). Please make sure to you run the compatible version of the backend when running the frontend.

`npm install`
